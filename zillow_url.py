"""
The function split_str() is a helper function to assist in string comparisons. 
The function takes in a string address, cleans the text, splits the address by spaces, 
and returns a list in which each word from the address is an element in the list. 
Ex. 
    input: '175 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10010'  
    output: ['175', 'fifth', 'avenue', 'new', 'york', 'ny', '10010']

    cleaned = address.lower().replace(",", "") # if the address is a string, the text is converted to lower case and commas are removed

"""
The function get_zillow_url() searches specifically for Zillow urls for a 
particular address through the use of a Google Custom Search Engine. 
The function takes in a written address, the Google API Key, and the 
Google Custom Search Engine Key.  The parameters are used to build a custom
Google search for Zillow urls and returns the url that matches information from 
the input address.  The Google API Key and Google Custom Search Engine Key 
are defaulted to the keys designated in the config.py file.
