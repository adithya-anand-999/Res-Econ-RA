# This function is written asynchronously as the google solar website is dynamic. Dynamic means the website takes some time to fully load, as such a delay exists 
# between initial website query and successful data collection. By writing our function asynchronously we are able to speed up data collection by querying the website 
# for a new address in the time we wait for the previous address to load with data. 

# We decided to use the playwright library for this as they offer modern support for chrome browsers allowing us to run our code across Windows and Mac.
